                <p>Patrizia Emmelie van der Pfefferkuchen, head of the Dragon Sciences And Magical Toad Training Department at
                   the University of Mugloar, was kind enough to explain to us that dragons are monogamous creatures who
                   greatly treasure romance and once they do find a partner, dragons are very likely to abandon their
                   destructive ways and look to engage in much more peaceful activities with their newly found Significant
                   Dragon.</p>
